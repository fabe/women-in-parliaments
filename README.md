What's the share of women and men in national parliaments?
====================

Equitable participation of men and women in political decision-making processes is a crucial part of building and maintaining a legitimate democracy. Even though women make up more than half of the worldâ€™s population, they are often under-represented as voters, heads of states or civil servants.

This website visualises the share of both men and women in the parliaments of the world. More than 200 nations and regions can be compared based on the gender distribution in their parliaments. The country specific data comes from an UN source and is updated monthly. The site also uses information from the website of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
